Hello and welcome to the Solar-Based Remote Control Smart Garden project! 
This project is designed to allow you to remotely control and monitor your garden using solar power. 
This read-me file will provide an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.

Overview:
The Solar-Based Remote Control Smart Garden project consists of the following components:

Solar panel
Charge controller
Battery
Raspberry pi(pico)
Motor driver
Water pump
Soil moisture sensor
Temperature and humidity sensor(if required)
Remote control
The solar panel charges the battery through the charge controller. The microcontroller controls the motor driver and water pump, based on the readings from the soil moisture sensor and temperature and humidity sensor. The remote control allows you to manually control the water pump.

Instructions:

Set up the hardware components as shown in the circuit diagram provided.
Upload the code to the microcontroller using the Thonny.
Place the soil moisture sensor in the soil of your garden and the temperature and humidity sensor in a shaded area near your garden.
Turn on the remote control and use the buttons to manually control the water pump.
The microcontroller will automatically turn on the water pump when the soil moisture is below a certain level or the temperature and humidity are above a certain level.

We hope you enjoy using the Solar-Based Remote Control Smart Garden project! Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or feedback.
